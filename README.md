## Install and run

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

`python main.py` runs the experiment exactly as configured; there are no
command-line flags, environment overrides, or notebook override hooks. A local
machine is fine for editing, but full runs need a GPU.

To change the experiment, edit the `config` dictionary inside `main()` in
[`main.py`](main.py). Each key is commented in place with its accepted values.
Give every run its own `experiment_name` and checkpoint subdirectories so that
resume never picks up another run's state.

## Run on Colab

Open [`HMP_GAE_Colab.ipynb`](HMP_GAE_Colab.ipynb), select a GPU runtime, and run
all cells. Its steps are: fetch the repository, install `requirements.txt`,
check the GPU and Hugging Face login, call `main()` without overriding anything,
render the metrics and per-client figures inline, print the numeric tables, zip
the `results/` artifacts for download, and release the runtime. Run the last
cell when you are done so the GPU is not held.

To use a plain Colab or any other cloud shell instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GuangLun2000/HMP-GAE.git
cd HMP-GAE
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Gated backbones such as Llama 3.2 require accepting the model license on Hugging
Face and providing `HF_TOKEN` (in Colab, add it under the sidebar's Secrets tab;
the notebook logs in automatically). GPU memory depends on the selected backbone,
precision, sequence length, and batch size; larger fp32 decoder runs need an
A100-class GPU.

## Outputs

Written to `results/`, named after `experiment_name`:

- `<experiment>_results.json` — the full config, per-round metrics, and defense
  diagnostics.
- `<experiment>_eval_ppl.json` — perplexity, when the backbone supports causal
  language modeling.
- `<experiment>_figure1.png` … `_figure5.png` — generated plots.
- A global checkpoint directory, plus a `peft_adapter/` when LoRA is enabled, if
  checkpoint saving is on. This checkpoint is what perplexity and
  `run_downstream_generation.py` consume.

Per-round resume snapshots are stored separately so an interrupted Colab session
can continue from the last completed round.
